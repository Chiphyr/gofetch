# âœ¨ Gofetch

Gofetch is a simple system information tool written in Go.  It can, currently, be used to display your machine's specifications, its temperature, and statistics such as the uptime.

Gofetch can be used on both Linux and Darwin (macOS).

## Installation

Installing gofetch is simple.  Download the binary for your operating system from [here](https://github.com/Chiphyr/gofetch/releases), being gofetch-linux for Linux, and gofetch-darwin for Darwin (macOS).

Once the binary is downloaded, simply rename it to `gofetch` and move it into a folder included in the `PATH`.  This could be `/usr/local/bin` (macOS) or `/usr/bin` (Linux), etc.

After moving it into `PATH`, you should be able to use `gofetch` after a shell restart.
